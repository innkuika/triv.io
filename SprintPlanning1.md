# triv.io

## Summary of Project: 
Our app, triv.io is a CS Trivia App that allows users to play with their friends and create new categories or even add to existing ones. It will be directly focused on computer science, however if we have time, after iterating over this category to perfection, we hope to build an interface that gives a generic user experience for all kinds of categories in order to reach a wider audience. The app will allow users to send instances of the quiz game to their friends, and allows them to test their knowledge of the particular category.
