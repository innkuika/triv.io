# triv.io

## Summary of Project: 
Our app, triv.io is a generic Trivia App that allows users to play with their friends and create new categories or even add to existing ones. We hope to build an interface that gives a generic user experience for all kinds of categories in order to reach a wider audience. The app will allow users to send instances of the quiz game to their friends, and allows them to test their knowledge of the particular category.
